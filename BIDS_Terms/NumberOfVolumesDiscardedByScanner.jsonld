  "description": "RECOMMENDED. Number of volumes (dummy scans) discarded by the scanner (as opposed to those discarded by the user post hoc) before saving the imaging file. For example, a sequence that automatically discards the first 4 volumes before saving would have this field as 4. A sequence that doesn't discard dummy scans would have this set to 0. Please note that the onsets recorded in the event.tsv file should always refer to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the corresponding imaging file - independent of the value of NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner field.",
